# Quick Steps to Create GitHub Repository

I've opened GitHub for you. Here's what to do:

## Steps:
1. **Sign in** to GitHub (if not already signed in)
2. The repository name should be pre-filled: `swaray-frozen-foods`
3. **Description**: "Premium frozen food showcase website"
4. Choose **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
5. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
6. Click **"Create repository"** button

## After Creating:
Once you create the repository, come back here and I'll push your code automatically!

The repository will be at: https://github.com/RidaFlame/swaray-frozen-foods
